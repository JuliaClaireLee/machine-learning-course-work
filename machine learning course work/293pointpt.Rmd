## Abstract

- The Cox proportional hazards model is often used for  analysis of survival time data in cancer. 

-  Proportional hazards (PH) are assumed. "With long-term follow-up, the PH assumption may be violated."


- Goal: The authors of the paper aim to account for these non-PH effects.
  - introduces the method, MFPT, an extension of the multivariable fractional polynomial (MFP) approach
     -  select influential variables. 
     -  determine  dose-response function for continuous variables.
     -  investigate time-varying effects.
     -  model such time-varying effects on a continuous scale.

## Key Words 
- Linear regression form:
  - $$y_i = b_0 + b_ix_i + b_2y_i+ b_2y_i^{2} + \epsilon_i$$
- $\textbf{Fractional polynomials:}$
  - an alternative to regular polynomials
  - provide  more flexible parameterization
  - $$y_i = b_0 + b_ix_i + b_2w_i^{p_1}+ b_3w_i^{p_2} + \epsilon_i$$
  - Fractional powers, $p_i$ are different from regular powers. 
  - For instance, $y^{p_1=0}$ is $ln(y)$
- $\textbf{proportional hazards:}$
  - exponential, Weibull, and Cox models are all proportional hazards (PH) models.
  - these models shift the hazard proportionally to the baseline
  - $$h_{A}(t) = Ch_{b}(t)$$
  - where C is the hazard ratio between B and A

## Key Words (cont.)
- $\textbf{The semiparametric proportional hazards model of Cox (1972):}$
  - developed by British statistician David Cox in 1972
  - popular model used in analysis of survival data
  - Goal: link the survival time of an individual to covariates
  - $$h(t) = h_0(t)+ exp(b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2+ b_3x_3 +....+ b_px_p)$$
    - t = the survival time
    - h(t) - the hazard function determined by a set of p covariates (x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_p)
  - Key assumptions: 
    - the proportional hazards function assumption
       - $\textbf{ each covariate's  multiplicative effect is constant over time.}$ 

## Introduction
- Most cancer studies and other medical studies use the the Cox semi-parametric proportional hazards model for survival time data analysis 
- proportional hazards (PH) are assumed for covariate effects, 
    - implying that the effect on the hazard function is constant throughout the whole study.
- problem: 
    - long-term follow-up studies show  that  the assumption of constant multiplicative effect for covariates becomes questionable.
    - Tumor size tend to strongly influence the short term prognosis 
    - The effect changes over time (decreasing)

The authors in the article propose procedure called $\textit{MFPT (multivariable fractional polynomial- time)}$: 

  - select influential variables  
  - determine dose-response functions for continuous variables
  - Whether there are time-varying effects 
  - Better model time-varying effects 


## past proposed solutions:
  - the baseline cumulative hazard function.
  - a step-function model 
  - relaxing the PH assumption and using  an interaction between a covariate and time.
  - fractional polynomials
  - estimating local time-varying coefficients
  
  The authors of the paper argue that it is unclear how useful these proposed methods are. 
  
  - In the article the authors perform MFPT on breast cancer data to compare differences from the previously considered methods. 
 
# Methods 
 
## Considerations
- Even if other variables don't change over time they might be effected by non-PH effects 
- Examining the PH assumption requires long term follow up.

- There have been solution for incorporating time-varying effects but there is no way to specify time-varying functions.  

- There are many tests to check the PH assumption 


 
## Multivariable FP:

 - Cox’s suggestion for incorporating time-varyng effects
 
 - Hazard function at time t>0 (usual 
 assumption of proportional hazards): 
 $$h(t|X) = h_0(t)exp[X'\beta]$$
 
 - To build a model, the authors use the MFP algorithm (Sauerbrei and Royston, 1999)
- The algorithm uses backward elimination 

It proceeds cyclically.

-  functional form determined univariately

- Convergence when  there are no further changes 
  - this is when FP transformation takes place
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
## Cox’s suggestion for incorporating time-varying effects.

- Cox in 1972 proposed a way to extend his model for non-proportional hazard effects:
$$h(t|X) = h_0(t)exp[X'\beta (t)]$$

Then this relative hazard becomes the function of X and t:
$$\frac{h(t|X)}{h_0(t)} = exp[X'\beta]$$

For a single variable Cox proposed using an unspecified function $\psi(t)$


$$h(t|X) = {h_0(t)}exp[\beta_0X + \beta_1\psi(t)X]$$

Where $\psi(t)X$ is a multiplicative interaction term that extends the orginial hazard function at time t > 0 . 


$\psi(t)X$ is hard to specify 
 
- Different choices of $\psi(t)X$ affect the analysis of possible time-varying effects


## $\psi(t)$ 
- The authors propose a method for  estimating $\psi(t)$ as an FP function of t

$$y_i = b_0 + b_ix_i + b_2w_i^{\psi(t)}+ b_3w_i^{\psi(t)} + \epsilon_i$$

- as a default $\psi(t)= log(t)$ 

- the authors choose a better $\psi(t)$ if indicated by the data. 

- The extension to multivariate fuction of time is done by stepwise selection








# New Proposal

## Stage 1  


select model $M_0$ using MFP algorithm using PH

$M_0$ is the model intially selected by $MFP$
, with time-fixed effects only.


the effect of at least one variable of interest varies in time, model M0 either mismodels its relative hazard as constant in time



  - PH assumption the estimated ‘average’ effect over the full time period could be  small.
  
  - more intial important variables could strongly increase the risk of an event near the beginning but then diminish over time.
  - check whether the variables is not included in $M_0$ is transient or short term effect. 
  

  
  

## Stage 2


1.) Start with the model $M_0$ 


censor all events when one half of all events have been observed. This is the defintion of short-term. 

2.) restrict the time period to $(0,\hat t)$ where $\hat t$ is the first half of events 


3.) 
re-apply MFP 
    
   - allow for  variables not selected in full time period 
  - Variables and FP selected in stage 1
      - regression coefficients are
      re-estimated
      - The FP functions (powers) kept fixed when studying time-varying effects.

This gives $M_1$

## FPT:
extend Cox’s basic approach for modelling a time-varying effect of a given covariate $X$

An FP1 function (or model) is defined as $$\psi_1(x;p) =  \beta_0 + \beta_1x^p$$

 
FP2 transformation of x with  $p = (p_1,p_2)$
is the vector $x^p$ with 

$$x^p = x ^{(p_1,p_2)} = \bigg\{(x^{p_1},x^{p_2}) \ p_1 
\neq p_2 \ \\
\  \ (x^{p_1},x^{p_2}, logx) \ p_1 
= p_2= p$$

$\beta = (\beta_1, \beta_2)$ and powers $p$ 
$$\psi_2(x;p) =  \beta_0 + x^p\beta$$


## 


time-varying Cox model based on untransformed X and an FP2 function of t with powers P = (q_1;q_2):


$$h(t|X) =h_0(t)exp[X_{\psi_2}(t; q)] =$$

$$= {h_0(t)}exp[X(\beta_0 + \beta_1t^{q_1}+\beta_2t^{q_2})] \, where \  q_1 \neq q_2 $$
$$= {h_0(t)}exp[X(\beta_0 + \beta_1t^{q_1}+\beta_2t^{q_2}log(t))] \, where\ q_1 = q_2 $$ 


compare deviance  difference of the models $\psi_j(t)$ and $\psi_k(t)$ where $j < k$ with 
$\chi_c^2$ valvues  $c= df$

 for example the deviance difference between $\psi_1(t)$ and $\psi_2(t)$ is compared with $\chi_2^2$. 
 
![](l.png){#id .class width=60% height=60%} 

If this test is significant, the more complex FP2 function $\psi_2(t)$  is chosen, otherwise the simpler FP1 function $\psi_1(t)$





## Stage 3:

1) For each covariate with the slected FP  of $M_1$ run the FPT algorithm. 

check for time varying effects. 

2) Use foward selection to select variables that give significant time varying effects to $M_1$. 

3) new model is $M_2$. 


  
# data 

## Cases

-  3001 patients from the Rotterdam breast cancer series:
  - primary breast cancer treatment 1973-1993
- excluding cases with missing information, $n = 2982$ for analysis. 
  -  missing information about the number of positive nodes (n = 11) 
  -  adjuvant treatment of node negative patients (n = 8)

## Variables 
![](data.png){#id .class width=75% height=75%}

## missing data:

- The variable Tumor grade was missing for 27% of the data. 

- The authors use MICE method of multivariate multiple imputation to account the missing values. 

- Missing data imputation is the idea  subsituting data for missing values. 

- Multiple imputation takes into account uncertainty in missing value imputation.

- The authors use the Stata program mvis (Royston, 2004) 

- We can do this in r with the mice package and the function mice()

-  X assigned to a time fixed hazard ratio of either 0.75 or 1.0
- 1000 simulations distributed time to event data without censoring. 
  - count the number of times we reject null hypothesis with no time varying effect. 
  

## conclusion

- Time-varying issues are more important for long term follow ups. 

- MFPT procedure handles the key stages of a model-building procedure for such problems. 

- MFPT is flexible enough to incorporate information. 

- Further investigatons into:  type I and type II error  at all 3 stages.
